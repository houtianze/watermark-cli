# Watermark CLI

A command-line tool for adding watermarks to images and PDFs with support for batch processing and various watermark patterns.
Designed to prevent identity theft and unauthorized copying of official documents through visible watermarking.

## Fork

- Adds color and opacity support
- Correctly loads image files with rotation/orientation information in metadata (exif)
- Cross compile to multiple platforms with binaries easily accessible from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/chianti-ga/watermark-cli/releases)

---

## Features

- Apply text watermarks to images in various patterns (diagonal, horizontal, vertical, random, cross-diagonal) (PDF
  support is planned for future releases but not currently implemented)
- Process single images or recursively process directories
- Parallel processing for batch operations using Rayon
- Customizable watermark spacing and JPEG compression quality

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed on your system

### Install from crates.io

``` bash
cargo install watermark-cli
```

### Building from source

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/chianti-ga/watermark-cli.git
cd watermark-cli
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

``` bash
watermark-cli <INPUT_PATH> <WATERMARK> [OPTIONS]
```

### Arguments

- `<INPUT_PATH>` - Path to the input image/pdf file or directory
- `<WATERMARK>` - Text to use as watermark

### Options

- `-c, --compression <COMPRESSION>` - JPEG quality (1-100) [default: 90]
- `-t, --text-scale <TEXT_SCALE>` - Watermark text scale [default: 0.05"]
- `-s, --space-scale <SPACE_SCALE>` - Vertical spacing between watermarks [default: 1.5]
- `-r, --recursive` - Recursively apply watermark to all images in the specified directory
- `-p, --pattern <PATTERN>` - Pattern of
  watermark [default: diagonal] [possible values: diagonal, horizontal, vertical, random, cross-diagonal] (NOT
  IMPLEMENTED AT THE MOMENT)
- `-h, --help` - Print help
- `-V, --version` - Print version

## Examples

Apply a diagonal watermark to a single image:

``` bash
watermark-cli sample.png "ONLY FOR IDENTITY VERIFICATION BY RENTAL AGENCY"
```

Customize watermark height/scale and compression:

``` bash
watermark-cli --text-scale 2.0 path/to/image.jpg "SAMPLE"
```

Process all images in a directory recursively with a custom pattern:

``` bash
watermark-cli --recursive --pattern horizontal path/to/directory/ "Confidential"
```

Customize watermark spacing and compression:

``` bash
watermark-cli --space-scale 2.0 --compression 80 path/to/image.jpg "SAMPLE"
```
